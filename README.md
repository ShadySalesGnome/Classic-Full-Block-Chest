# Classic-Full-Block-Chest
A Minecraft resource pack that utilizes custom entity models to bring back full block sized chests


**About**:
------------
This pack utilizes Optifine's custom entity models or Entity Model Features to bring back full block sized chests, like the chests used to be before Beta 1.8 and Minecraft's official release in 2011.

This works with chests, trapped chests, and ender chests,
there is no chest opening animation, and it will likely cause problems with the Christmas chest.

Optifine or Entity Model Features is required for this pack to function.
